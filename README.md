This program was built on the following requirements:

* Create a system that will instantiate customer objects from files. Samples of these files are included in the doc folder.
  * Read from CSV files with headers.
  * Read from XML files.
  * Read from JSON files.

# Your task
Re-evaluate the architecture, design, and implementation of the solution:
*	You have full control and are free to re-design it from the ground up. Utilize what you consider to be best practices and architecture/design principles and patterns.
  * If something doesn't make sense to you, feel free to change it.
*	Make sure the code is ready for a production environment.
*	Ensure that the code is easily readable and maintanable.
*	Make sure there are no bugs or errors in the code.
